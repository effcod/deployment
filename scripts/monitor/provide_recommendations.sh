echo "===================== PIPELINE PERFORMANCE RECOMMENDATIONS ====================="
echo "Based on the monitoring results, here are some recommendations:"
echo ""
echo "1. Producer Delays:"
echo "   - If producer->Kafka delay is high: Check network latency and producer settings"
echo "   - Relevant configs: linger.ms, batch.size, buffer.memory"
echo ""
echo "2. Kafka Broker Performance:"
echo "   - If broker shows high CPU/memory: Consider scaling up the VM"
echo "   - If disk I/O is high: Consider faster disks or tuning log flush settings"
echo "   - Relevant configs: num.io.threads, log.flush.interval.messages"
echo ""
echo "3. Consumer Delays:"
echo "   - If consumer lag is growing: Scale consumers or optimize processing"
echo "   - If uncommitted offsets detected: Review consumer commit configuration"
echo "   - Not committing offsets doesn't directly affect broker performance,"
echo "     but will cause message reprocessing if consumer restarts"
echo "   - Relevant configs: auto.commit.interval.ms, enable.auto.commit"
echo ""
echo "4. Impact of Not Committing Offsets:"
echo "   - Memory impact: Broker keeps consumer group metadata for all groups"
echo "   - Reprocessing risk: Messages will be reprocessed on consumer restart"
echo "   - No direct impact on broker throughput/performance"
echo "   - For mission-critical data, use explicit commits after processing"
echo ""
echo "For detailed performance monitoring, consider:"
echo "- JMX monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana for Kafka metrics"
echo "- Adding timestamps to messages at each processing stage"
echo "- Implementing metrics collection in producer/consumer applications"
